###[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) support for HTML5 media elements

ng-media provides a simple, declarative means for using HTML5 audio and video elements.

A simple example:

```html
<div data-html5-video="movies/easterbunny.mp4"
     track="captions/easterbunny.vtt"
     controls="true">
  <p class="bordered-text">
    HTML, including custom video controls, can be overlayed easily over the
    video frame.
  </p>
</div>
```

More advanced features are also possible:

```js
$scope.videoSources = [{
  src: "media/farmville.webm",
  type: "video/webm",
  media: "screen"
}, 'media/farmville.mp4'];

$scope.videoTracks = {
  src: "captions/moocow.vtt",
  kind: "captions",
  type: "text/vtt"
};
```

```html
<script type="text/ng-template" id="customControls.tpl">
  <div class="custom-controls">
    <button ng-click="video.$play()">Play Button</button>
    <button ng-click="video.$pause()">Pause Button</button>
    <!-- Volume controls -->
    <input ng-init="vol=1" type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.05"
           ng-model="vol" ng-change="video.$volume(vol)" />
  </div>
</script>
<div data-html5-video="videoSources"
     track="videoTracks"
     controls-url="customControls.tpl"></div>
```

**coming soon**

- Integrated support for playlists
- Audio directive
- Live demo
- ngdocs page

**hopefully some day**
